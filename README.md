# docs-experiment

A test repo for documentation technologies and processes.

See under `hugo` for an example using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). You
need to install Hugo first before using.

```
% cd hugo
% hugo serve
...
Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/

```

Point your browser at http://localhost:1313/ to see the documentation.

Please observe that this is just an example with cut and pasted
documentation and a Hugo theme chosen by random.
