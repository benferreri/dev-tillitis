To build you need the `clang`, `llvm`, `lld`, `golang` packages
installed. Version 15 or later of LLVM/Clang is required (with riscv32
support and Zmmul extension). Ubuntu 22.10 (Kinetic) is known to have
this and work. Please see
[toolchain_setup.md](https://github.com/tillitis/tillitis-key1/blob/main/doc/toolchain_setup.md)
(in the tillitis-key1 repository) for detailed information on the
currently supported build and development environment.
